This repository contains the full code pipeline used in the study:

[INSERT FINAL TITLE]

It includes all the steps used to clean the phenotype data, define the case and control phenotypes, and perform health-outcome analyses. The data used for this analysis cannot be shared due to confidentiality, but all scripts and workflow details needed to reproduce the analysis on permitted datasets are provided.

## Repository Structure

- `01_data_cleaning/`  
  Scripts for cleaning demographic and clinical phenotype data.

- `02_case_control_phenotype_definition/`  
  Scripts defining cALT cases and control cohorts.

- `03_health_outcomes_analysis/`  
  Scripts analysing health outcomes in cases vs controls.



## Data Provenance and Preprocessing
Some of the data used in this analysis was provisionally cleaned and curated by the Genes and Health Team. The majority of phenotypes used for the binary health outcomes (e.g. hypertension, diabetes) were curated by the G&H team (codelist available publicly at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipwdF2j_owfr_QbkDYk1rk0TW3KtdfQYVQn-Vf-o38s/edit?gid=750982921#gid=750982921. Health outcome phenotypes generated ourselves include cardiovascular disease, ethnically adjusted BMI categories and NAFLD. 

For quantitative data used in this study, values from primary care were used that had already had the following preprocessing steps applied by the G&H data team prior to our analysis:
1)	Upload data from all available electronic healthcare records including primary and secondary care 
2)	Exclude non-numeric values 
3)	Use of custom codelists to identify all occurrences of a specific outcome variable in the electronic health records 
4)	Harmonise all units – exclusion of any test results which did not have units that could be simply converted to IU/L
5)	Exclude readings outside pre-specified min/max ranges (aim to remove results which are likely a result of technical or lab errors)
6)	Exclude test results obtained before the age of 18 years 
7)	Exclude test results with a missing date 
8)	De-duplicate test results 
a.	Deduplicated test results for the same patient if two results with exact same value in 10 day period
9) exclude all data values from secondary care
    
Our analysis uses this pre-cleaned dataset, and additional analysis-specific cleaning steps are applied in the scripts below.


## Workflow

1. Data Cleaning (01_data_cleaning/)

These scripts prepare the demographic and clinical dataset for case/control construction.

1.1_clean_baseline_demographics.R
Cleans and formats the demographic dataset, including variables such as age, sex, and ethnicity. 

1.2_compute_mean_quantitative_variables_from_primary_care
This script calculates the lifetime mean values for quantitative continuous clinical markers (e.g., ALT, AST, bilirubin, weight), using all available values from primary care. The quantitative values utilised have already had some cleaning performed on them by the Genes & Health team - the steps of this cleaning are outlined above in 'data provenance and reprocessing'. 

1.3_create_NAFLD_cohort_excluding_ALD.R
Creates a NAFLD cohort using the phenotype generated by the G&H team using ICD codes, and then explicitly removing individuals with alcohol-related liver disease (ALD).

1.4_join_binary_and_quantitative_outcomes_to_demographics.R
Combines processed phenotype outcomes with demographic information to create a unified analysis-ready dataset.


| Script | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| `1.1_clean_baseline_demographics.R` | Cleans and formats demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity) | Raw demographic data | Cleaned demographic dataset |
| `1.2_compute_mean_quantitative_variables_from_primary_care.R` | Computes lifetime mean values for quantitative clinical markers (e.g. ALT, AST, bilirubin, weight) | Pre-cleaned primary care quantitative data | Summary table of lifetime mean values |
| `1.3_create_NAFLD_cohort_excluding_ALD.R` | Creates NAFLD cohort and excludes individuals with alcohol-related liver disease | ICD-based liver disease phenotypes | NAFLD cohort definition |
| `1.4_join_binary_and_quantitative_outcomes_to_demographics.R` | Merges demographic data with binary and quantitative phenotype outcomes | Cleaned demographics and phenotype datasets | Unified analysis-ready dataset |



2. Case–Control Definition (folder: case_control_creation)

2.1_define_cALT_cases_for_GWAS.R
Defines cases with chronic ALT elevation (cALT) according to clinical and temporal definitions and exclusions as outlined in study methods.

2.2_define_control_group_for_GWAS.R
Constructs a high-quality control cohort by excluding individuals with liver disease, significant alcohol intake, or other confounding medical conditions.

| Script | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| `2.1_define_cALT_cases_for_GWAS.R` | Identifies chronic ALT elevation (cALT) cases using study-specific thresholds and temporal criteria | Cleaned ALT dataset | cALT case cohort |
| `2.2_define_control_group_for_GWAS.R` | Constructs a control cohort by excluding individuals with liver disease, alcohol misuse, or other confounding conditions | Cleaned ALT values dataset | control cohort |

3. Health Outcomes Analysis (folder: health_outcomes_analysis)

3.1_join_health_outcomes_to_cases_and_controls.R
Links health-outcome variables (e.g., diagnoses, events, biomarkers) to previously defined cases and controls.

3.2_cases_vs_controls_health_outcomes_analysis.R
Performs statistical comparisons between cALT cases and controls, producing summary tables and results for baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes.

| Script | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| `3.1_join_health_outcomes_to_cases_and_controls.R` | Links health outcome phenotypes to defined cases and controls | Case and control cohorts; curated outcome phenotypes | Analysis dataset with health outcomes |
| `3.2_cases_vs_controls_health_outcomes_analysis.R` | Performs statistical comparisons of health outcomes between cases and controls | Health outcomes analysis dataset | Summary tables and statistical results |
